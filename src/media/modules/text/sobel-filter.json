The filter uses a 3x3 kernel that detects the image gradient, a directional change in color in the image, for a given direction. The example kernel detects a change in color between the left and right sides of the current pixel, which indicates a vertical edge. ",

The demo below calculates the images resulting from filtering by the eight Sobel kernels (4 directions, 2 filters per direction for dark-to-light and light-to-dark) for a stop sign image.

Instead of wanting to extract the overall structure of the image, now we are interested in extracting portions of an image that follow a specific directional pattern. The canonical example of this is wanting to extract stripes on a zebra that are in a particular direction.",

We can also specify a frequency or magnitude for the directionality that assesses how strong the directionality is as a filter.",

This can be highly effective when scanning images which contain text where we only want to retain the text in the image. The reason for this is that images generally have lower directional content as they are smoother relative to text.",

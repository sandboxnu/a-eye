When the algorithm encounters a point that has been misclassified, it finds the vector representing the distance, d, between that point our dividing line. To update the dividing line, we subtract d from Wt. This new vector corresponds to a new perpendicular line, which forms a more accurate division between the inputs. Use the buttons below to walk through the steps of updating the dividing line. You can always click 'Previous Step' to revisit any parts you may have missed.",

You can also change the learning rate to see how it affects the line changes when training. Be careful though, a learning rate that is too high may cause the line to never converge; similarly, a learning rate that is too low make that too long to learn. Add more points the graph to customize how your line changes! You can always restart the demo by clicking 'Reset', and remove all the points by clicking 'Clear All'. ",
